This repository contains the implementation of my master's thesis project in collaboration with the **Technical University of Denmark (DTU)**. The goal of this project is to develop a **Universal Diagram Editor** that enables easy creation and customization of graphical notations and their use in a diagram editor, serving to both graphical notation developers and diagram creators.

## Author

- **Name**: Mikail Cengiz
- **University**: Technical University of Denmark (DTU)
- **Supervisor**: Ekkart Kindler

## Project Overview

This project leverages **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** principles to allow the creation of custom graphical notations. The editor is designed to:

1. Enable graphical notation developers to define graphical notations.
2. Support diagram creators in creating models using these notations through a user-friendly interface.

Key concepts include:

- **Meta-Modeling:** Using Ecore-based metamodels to structure graphical notations.
- **Dynamic Diagram Editor:** Dynamic editor that support updates to graphical notations without having the editor's codebase re-generated.
- **Customizability:** Allowing users to define syntax, semantics, and visual appearances of modeling languages.

## Features

- Support for defining graphical notations based on the Ecore meta-metamodel.
- Mapping of meta-models to digram editor to support dynamic modifications to the metamodel.
- Export of diagram models.
